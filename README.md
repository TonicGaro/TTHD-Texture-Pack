If you want to know how to use this texture pack yourself go [here](https://raymanpc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=74787).

Credits to XanderNT for remaking some of the textures. Credits to [RayCarrot](https://github.com/RayCarrot) also, for updating Rayman Control Panel to be compatible with this texture pack. Credits to [Hipnosis183](https://www.deviantart.com/hipnosis183) on DevianArt, I got the high quality Tonic Trouble logo from them. Finally, credits to [icup321](https://github.com/icup321) for finding a lot of official high quality textures. These textures were used for better looking results in the final product. Not all the official high quality textures have been found but once they are, I'll be sure to update this texture pack.

### Instructions on how to import the source textures into a Textures.cnt file:

Get the latest version of [Rayman Control Panel](https://github.com/RayCarrot/RayCarrot.RCP.Metro/releases).

Go to the "Utilities" tab and open the "Textures.cnt" file. It should be located in the "GAMEDATA" folder of Tonic Trouble (Retail).

Right click on the folder that contains the texture(s) you want to replace and click "Import & convert". If you want to replace textures in multiple folders just right click the root directory and import there. 

Once you've saved your changes make sure to sync the texture info before you start the game. "Utilities>Other" select the "GAMEDATA" folder when syncing.
